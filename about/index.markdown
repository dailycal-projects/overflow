Welcome to Overflow, the blog and gallery of the Daily Californian projects team. We’re a group of student journalists and programmers trying to make sense of the data that surrounds UC Berkeley, the University of California and the city of Berkeley. We’re experimenting with tools to make the Daily Cal’s coverage more thorough and with stories that aren’t possible on the printed page.

On this blog, we’ll write about how we approached our projects, the methodology we used for understanding our data and the code that makes it all possible.

[All of our projects’ source code is public](https://github.com/dailycal-projects). We believe transparency in reporting extends to the way we build our projects, and we’re making every effort to clean, document and release the data that we’ve analyzed.

If you have a data set you think we’d like to look at or a question regarding one of our projects, shoot us an email at [projects@dailycal.org](mailto:projects@dailycal.org). Keep connected with us on Twitter by following [@overflow_dc](https://twitter.com/overflow_dc). 

Fiat lux!
